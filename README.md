# Covid-19-Awareness-Quiz-App

I made android app using Flutter and Dart language. Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google.

Questions for the quiz are primarily based on do’s and don’ts, myth busters and any other information related to COVID-19. This quiz is conducted to spread awareness and disseminate the right information about COVID-19 amongst Citizens.
